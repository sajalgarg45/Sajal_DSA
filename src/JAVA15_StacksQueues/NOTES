STACKS :

Algorithm - LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out)
Push
Pop
Peek

QUEUES :

Algorithm - FIFO (First In First Out) or LILO (Last In Last Out)
Insertion
Removal

In trees, we extensively use Stack and Queues

DEQUE :

Algorithm - we can insert/delete from start and last , both sides
When we do trees , there it will be use


CUSTOM STACK :

We took a pointer , as we add the items in stack the pointer is acts as a index and increments
to add the values inside the custom stack

in dynamic stack , only thing we need to change is the push method
we need to override it
implementation

data = [2,9,1,8,7]
temp = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

data copy to temp

temp = [2,9,1,8,7,0,0,0,0,0]
now data is pointing to temp , and temp is removed

data = [2,9,1,8,7,0,0,0,0,0]
