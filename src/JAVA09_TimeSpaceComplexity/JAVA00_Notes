Space Complexity -> Auxiliary Space + Input Space
Auxiliary Space -> the space you take to solve the problem
Input space -> the space you take to store the input

Take an input of A and B
C = A + B
Auxiliary Space -> C -> extra variable (space) to take to solve the problem
Input Space -> A and B are the input space
So conclude space complexity is O(A+B+C) -> O(1+1+1) -> O(1) -> Constant

if there is an array -> arr[n] -> the space complexity is O(n)
never do anything to input -> because data should not be touched

Recursive Functions ->

no two functions at a same level will be in the stack at a same level
they have to execute in order weather their level in recursive tree is same or not
Only calls that are interlinked will be in the stack at he same time , the order should be same linear
Space complexity  = height (Path) of the tree
