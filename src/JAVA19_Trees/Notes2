What Is a Rotation?

A rotation is an operation that re-structures part of the tree while keeping
the in-order traversal (sorted order) the same.

There are two basic rotations:
1) Right Rotation (clockwise)
2) Left Rotation (anti-clockwise)

Two combined (double) rotations:
1) Left-Right Rotation
2) Right-Left Rotation

Balance Factor (BF) = height(left subtree) − height(right subtree)

* Right Rotation - Used when the tree is Left-Heavy (BF > 1)

Before rotation:

     30   -> Node 30 has BF = +2 (unbalanced)
    /
   20
  /
 10

After right rotation (around 30):

    20
   /  \
 10   30

 * Left Rotation - Used when the tree is Right-Heavy (BF < -1)

 Before Rotation:

 10
   \
    20
      \
       30

After Rotation:

    20
   /  \
  10   30
