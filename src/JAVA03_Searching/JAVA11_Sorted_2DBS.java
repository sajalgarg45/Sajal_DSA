Matrix -

1   2   3   4
5   6   7   8
9   10  11  12
13  14  15  16

Rows are sorted:

Row 1 → [1, 2, 3, 4]
Row 2 → [5, 6, 7, 8]
Row 3 → [9, 10, 11, 12]
Row 4 → [13, 14, 15, 16]

Columns are sorted:
Column 1 → [1, 5, 9, 13]
Column 2 → [2, 6, 10, 14]
Column 3 → [3, 7, 11, 15]
Column 4 → [4, 8, 12, 16]

Key Property:
The entire matrix behaves as a sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].

difference form previous matrix is that the last element of the row is smaller than first element
of the next row

Row 1 → [1, 2, 3, 4]
Row 2 → [5, 6, 7, 8]

here 4<5
